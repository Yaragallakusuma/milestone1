<h1><b>All About Nature </b> </h1>
<h4> <big> <i>Sometimes Nature Is All You Need </i></big> </h4> 
<p><u> Nature is a part of our life </u>. We grew out of the earth, and we part if all that ,but we are rapidly losing the sense that we are animals like the others. Can you have a feeling for a tree, look at it,see the beauty of it listen to the sound it makes? can you be sensitive to the little plant ,a little weed, to that creeper growing up the wall,to the light on the leaves and the many shadows? One must be aware of all this and habe that sense of communion with the nature around you. You may live in a town, but you do have that sense og and there. A flower in the next garden may be ill-kept ,crowded with the weeds, but look at it, feel that yu are a part of all that, part of all living things.if ypu hurt nature, ypu are hurting yourself.</p>
<p> There is a great deal of talk and <u> endeavour to protect nature the animals</u>, the whales and dolphins, to clean the polluted rivers, lakes fields and so on. <br>Nature is not put together by thought , as religion and belief.</br> Nature is the tiger, that extraordinary animal with its energy, its great sense of power. Nature is the solitary tree in the field, the meadows and the grove; it is that squirrel shyly hiding behind a bough. Nature is ant, bee and all the living things of the earth.</p>
